# The Catcher in the Rye

## A Journey with the hat

The hat represent self-ego, prime, self-personalities

**Chapter 3**. *Positive*. [The hat appeared first time]. 

> I took off my coat and my tie and unbuttoned my shirt collar; and then I put on this hat that I'd bought in New York that morning. It was this red hunting hat, with one of those very, very long peaks. I saw it in the window of this sports store when we got out of the subway, just after I noticed I'd lost all the goddam foils. It only cost me a buck. The way I wore it, I swung the old peak way around to the back very corny, I'll admit, but **I liked it that way.**

**Chapter 3**. *Positive*. [The hat appeared first time]. 

> Anyway, I put on my new hat and sat down and started reading that book Out of Africa.

**Chapter 3**. *Positive*. 

> What I did was, I pulled the old peak of my hunting hat around to the front, then pulled it way down over my eyes. That way, I couldn't see a goddam thing.

**Chapter 3**. *Positive*. [Horse around with the hat]. 

> I sort of closed one eye, like I was taking aim at it. "This is a people shooting hat," I said. "I shoot people in this hat."

**Chapter 4**. *Neutral*

> Anyway, I was sitting on the washbowl next to where Stradlater was shaving, sort of turning the water on and off. I still had my red hunting hat on, with the peak around to the back and all. I really got a bang out of that hat.

**Chapter 4**. *Neutral*. [Seeking approval from others]. 

> I was out of breath anyway, so I quit horsing around. I took off my hat and looked at it for about the ninetieth time. "I got it in New York this morning. For a buck. Ya like it?"

**Chapter 4**. *Negative*.  

> I pulled the peak of my hunting hat around to the front all of a sudden, for a change. I was getting sort of nervous, all of a sudden. I'm quite a nervous guy. "Listen, where ya going on your date with her?" I asked him. "Ya know yet?"

**Chapter 5**. *Neutral*. [Encouraging himself]. 

> After he left, I put on my pajamas and bathrobe and my old hunting hat, and started writing the composition.

**Chapter 6**. *Neutral*. [Encouraging himself]. 

> I kept sitting there on the floor till I heard old Stradlater close the door and go down the corridor to the can. Then I got up. I couldn't find my goddam hunting hat anywhere. Finally I found it. It was under the bed. I put it on, and turned the old peak around to the back, **the way I liked it**, and then I went over and took a look at my stupid face in the mirror.

**Chapter 7**. *Neutral*. [Encouraging himself]. 

> I put my red hunting hat on, and turned the peak around to the back, the way I liked it, and then I yelled at the top of my goddam voice, "Sleep tight, ya morons!" 

**Chapter 8**. *Neutral*. [Encouraging himself]. 

> He'd smacked my lip right on my teeth, and it was pretty sore. My ears were nice and warm, though. That hat I bought had earlaps in it, and I put them on I didn't give a damn how I looked. Nobody was around anyway. Everybody was in the sack.

**Chapter 8**. *Negative*. [Hiding the hat]

> I just sort of sat and not did anything. All I did was take off my hunting hat and put it in my pocket.

**Chapter 10**. *Negative*. [Talking about others' hats]

> The whole three of them were pretty ugly, and they all had on the kind of hats that you knew they didn't really live in New York

> They were so ignorant, and they had those sad, fancy hats on and all. 

>  If somebody, some girl in an awful-looking hat, for instance, comes all the way to New York from Seattle, Washington, for God's sake

**Chapter 13**. *Neutral*. [Frozen and angry]

> But it was freezing cold, and I took my red hunting hat out of my pocket and put it on I didn't give a damn how I looked. I even put the earlaps down. I wished I knew who'd swiped my gloves at Pencey, because my hands were freezing.

**Chapter 13**. *Neutral*. [Imply the prostitute had no personalities]

> When I opened the door, this prostitute was standing there. She had a polo coat on, and no hat. She was sort of a blonde, but you could tell she dyed her hair.

**Chapter 16**. *Neutral*. [Poor people's hats]

> The father had on one of those pearl-gray hats that poor guys wear a lot when they want to look sharp. He and his wife were just walking along, talking, not paying any attention to their kid.

**Chapter 16**. *Neutral*. 

> I took my old hunting hat out of my pocket while I walked, and put it on. I knew I wouldn't meet anybody that knew me, and it was pretty damp out.

**Chapter 17**. *Neutral*. [Old Sally hardly wore a hat]

> Finally, old Sally started coming up the stairs, and I started down to meet her. She looked terrific. She really did. She had on this black coat and sort of a black beret. She hardly ever wore a hat, but that beret looked nice.

**Chapter 20**. *Negative*. [The hat-check room]

> When I finally got down off the radiator and went out to the hat-check room, I was crying and all.

> She was nice, though. I showed her my goddam red hunting hat, and she liked it. She made me put it on before I went out, because my hair was still pretty wet. She was all right.

**Chapter 21**. *Negative*.

> I'd already taken off my hunting hat, so as not to look suspicious or anything.

**Chapter 23**. *Positive*

>  Then I took my hunting hat out of my coat pocket and gave it to her. She likes those kind of crazy hats. She didn't want to take it, but I made her. I'll bet she slept with it on. She really likes those kind of hats. Then I told her again I'd give her a buzz if I got a chance, and then I left.

**Chapter 25**. *Neutral*

> Finally, I saw her. I saw her through the glass part of the door. The reason I saw her, she had my crazy hunting hat on you could see that hat about ten miles away.

**Chapter 25**. *Neutral*

> She wouldn't answer me. All she did was, she took off my red hunting hat the one I gave her and practically chucked it right in my face. Then she turned her back on me again. 

**Chapter 25**. *Neutral*. [Cowboy hat from a boy]

> There was a little kid standing next to me, with a cowboy hat on practically over his ears, and he kept telling his father, "Make him come out, Daddy. Make him come out." 

**Chapter 25**. *Negative*.

> Then what she did it damn near killed me she reached in my coat pocket and took out my red hunting hat and put it on my head.

**Chapter 25**. *Positive*.

>  I got pretty soaking wet, especially my neck and my pants. My hunting hat really gave me quite a lot of protection, in a way; but I got soaked anyway. I didn't care, though. I felt so damn happy all of sudden, the way old Phoebe kept going around and around. I was damn near bawling, I felt so damn happy, if you want to know the truth.
